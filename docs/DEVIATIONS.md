# DEVIATIONS — intentional differences from the original

Every deliberate departure from `https://vibecoders.global/` (as captured in
`docs/spec/`), each with a one-line rationale. Seeded by the contracts task.
**Section builders never edit this file** — each logs its entries (final URL choices,
mobile adaptations, hover/press approximations) in its own `docs/deviations/NN-slug.md`,
which the integrator (orchestrator) consolidates here at merge time.

## Structure & semantics

### Current four-page interface improvements — 2026-10-14

These approved improvements apply to the active four-page implementation, rather than the historical eleven-section reconstruction described below.

- **[a11y] Scalable typography and layout:** active font sizes and responsive breakpoint thresholds use rem units. Fractional grid tracks can shrink, long values wrap, statistics adapt to available space, and the mobile header can wrap at enlarged text sizes. Default font size remains controlled by the browser.
- **[a11y] Surface-aware focus:** the semantic `--color-focus` token uses blue on light backgrounds and paper on green, blue, and ink surfaces, preserving the 3px outline and 6px offset.
- **[content/a11y] Readable communities:** the About map retains its artwork and gains a wrapping list introduced by “Communities include,” listing the seven example cities already described by its alt text. This is not a claim of an exhaustive current chapter roster.
- **[content] Partnership hierarchy:** Companies gains a hero enquiry action using the existing contextual email destination, retains its closing enquiry action, and renders the header event action with the secondary light treatment.
- **[content] Destination labels:** Events uses “View London events” and “View European events,” preserving both organiser URLs.
- **[a11y] Reading comfort:** principle statements and the testimonial use 1.4 line-height; image disclosures and team roles use 0.8125rem. These intentionally differ from the previous compact typography.
- **[approx] Mobile menu feedback:** the entrance keyframes are removed; native details behavior and the keyboard/outside-click enhancement remain.

- **[arch] Single semantic DOM instead of three `data-breakpoint` DOM copies.** The
  original renders all three breakpoint variants into the DOM and toggles them with
  `display:none`. We author each section once and adapt with media queries — smaller,
  maintainable, and it removes the copy-drift the original carries between variants.
- **[a11y] Real heading hierarchy instead of all-`<p>`.** The original emits every
  heading and paragraph as `<p>`/`<span>`/`<li>` (Figma Sites left `accessibleHTMLTag`
  generic). We use `<h1>` (hero), `<h2>` (section headings), `<h3>` (card titles) with
  their visual size supplied by type utilities, so the document outlines correctly.
- **[arch] Nav is FIRST in the DOM (in a `<header>` banner), not a last-in-DOM overlay.**
  The original puts the sticky nav as the final node inside a full-page
  `pointer-events:none` overlay. We place it first in a real `<header>`, and section 01
  pins it with `position: fixed` (the short `<header>` can't host a page-wide `sticky`).
  Cleaner landmarks (`header > nav`, `main`, `footer`), same pinned-at-top result.
- **[arch] Landmarks:** exactly one `<header>` (banner) containing the `<nav>`, one
  `<main id="app">` (sections 02–10), one `<footer>` (contentinfo = section 11's root).
  The original's `<main tabindex="-1">` + `.bypass-link` skip pattern is not reproduced
  (no skip link yet); revisit if we add one.

## Desktop-canonical copy (resolving the cross-breakpoint drift, spec §5)

Where the three DOM copies disagree, **desktop (1280) copy is canonical**. Known items:

- **[content] Cities list (§04).** Use the desktop set/order/casing: `berlin`, `delft`,
  `Kyiv`, `London` (links) + `boston` `TBA`, `Edinburgh` `TBA` (Scotland flag on
  Edinburgh). We do **not** show tablet's `Lisbon` or mobile's `Delft`/`edinburgh`
  variants. (`berlin` and `boston` stay lowercase — intentional original casing.)
- **[content] Team roster (§06).** Use the tablet/desktop **12-person** grid with **Dan
  Porder first**, not mobile's 8-person / Sofiia-first ordering.
- **[content] Project eyebrow (§05).** `From "What If?" → to a Vibe App` (desktop), not
  the mobile/tablet `→ to an app`.
- **[content] Sponsor bullets (§07).** Each "Why Partner With Us" bullet is a **single
  run** (desktop), not the mobile/tablet split-lead-phrase form. Bolding the lead
  sentence on small screens is an allowed optional embellishment.
- **[content] Contact "Email:" label (§10).** Shown (desktop) above the address; the
  mobile/tablet omission is not followed.
- **[content] Footer WhatsApp casing (§11).** Use desktop `What'sApp` (curly apostrophe).
  BUT the original makes desktop `What'sApp` **plain text** while mobile/tablet link it —
  the footer builder should keep it a **link** (href
  `https://chat.whatsapp.com/BxLUpQMiXwo6d1vG7YSirT`) for usable UX, and log that choice
  in `docs/deviations/11-footer.md`.
- **[content] Nav contents per breakpoint (§01) are RESPONSIVE, not a copy conflict.**
  Keep all three states as show/hide: mobile = logo + `contact for more`; tablet = +
  `find an event`; desktop = + the three `for …` scroll links.
- **[content] Project-card DOM order (§05).** Keep desktop order (Immersive 3D, Motion
  Tracking, Open Data Integration, The Unexpected); ignore the mobile/tablet middle-two swap.

> **Preserved as-is (NOT deviations — do not "fix"):** mixed curly vs straight
> apostrophes; the double space after `120 minutes.`; trailing spaces in a few
> source strings. Reproduce verbatim (see spec §7).
>
> The original's contradictory membership/country figures were also on this list
> until go-live; they are now reconciled — see **Content corrections** below.

## Content corrections (go-live, 2026-07-16)

The clone reproduced the original's self-contradicting membership and country figures
verbatim, per spec §7. That was right while this repo was a fidelity exercise. It stopped
being right the moment the clone became the real `vibecoders.global` under our own name.
**Operator decision (2026-07-16): reconcile to the true figures.**

- **[content] Membership reads `4,000+` everywhere.** The original says `4,000+` (§03
  hero), `1,200+` (§06 lede) and `1,100+` (§07 lede + bullet) — a ~4x spread, with the
  `1,100+` sitting inside a "No inflated numbers" pledge that the hero contradicted.
- **[content] Countries reads `10` everywhere.** The original says `9` (§03 stat),
  "Seven countries" (§03 desc) and "7 countries" (§07 lede + bullet).
- **[content] RESOLVED — the §03 flag row now carries 10 flags, matching the stat.** The
  original shipped **8** flags (🇬🇧🇩🇪🇺🇸🇯🇵🇺🇦🇵🇹🇳🇱🇵🇰) against its own stat of `9`. The
  operator confirmed the roster (2026-07-16), so the row now reads
  🇺🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇳🇱🇵🇹🇮🇳🇺🇦🇯🇵🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇩🇪🇵🇰 — US, **England**, Netherlands, Portugal, **India**, Ukraine,
  Japan, **Scotland**, Germany, Pakistan. Measured against the original's 8: **7 are kept**
  (US, NL, PT, UA, JP, DE, PK), the single 🇬🇧 (GB) is **replaced by separate England +
  Scotland flags** — consistent with §04, which already flags Edinburgh with the Scotland
  flag — and **India** is added. Net 8 − 1 + 3 = **10**: the flags were raised to match the
  stat, not the stat filed down to match the flags.
- **[content] England and Scotland are encoded as TAG SEQUENCES,** not regional-indicator
  pairs: `U+1F3F4` + 6 tag chars (`gbeng` / `gbsct`) + the `U+E007F` cancel tag. The tag
  chars are **invisible** in an editor, so the run looks like it carries stray characters —
  do not "tidy" it. Edit it by codepoint and re-check the grapheme count is 10:
  `[...new Intl.Segmenter("en",{granularity:"grapheme"}).segment(run)].length`. Rendering
  caveat for the two tag sequences: see the emoji-fallback bullet under **Fonts & emoji**.

## Links / URLs

- **[content] Prefer stable base URLs over dated `/events/NNN/` links.** The original's
  `berlin`/`London`/`Lisbon` point at single-event Meetup pages (e.g.
  `…/events/312898072/`) that will go stale. Recommend the base URLs as canonical
  (`berlin → https://www.meetup.com/vibe-coding-collective-eu/`,
  `London → https://luma.com/bhfumnou`). **Final per-link choice is the section 04
  builder's**, and each substitution must be logged in `docs/deviations/04-for-vibe-coders.md`
  (consolidated here by the integrator).
- **[content] `target` behavior** from spec §7 is otherwise reproduced (most CTAs/city
  links `_blank`; the Contact-CTA `contact for more` and footer WhatsApp are `_self`).

## Fonts & emoji

- **[perf] Golos Text self-hosted as a single VARIABLE woff2 per subset (latin,
  latin-ext), not 6 static per-weight files.** Google serves one variable file
  (`wght` 400–900) that the browser instances to 500/700/900; `font-weight: 400 900`
  covers all three design weights. Total payload ≈ 60 KB (well under the 1.5 MB budget).
- **[perf] Cyrillic / Cyrillic-ext subsets dropped.** All site copy is Latin; no Cyrillic
  content exists. (The original ships 6 subsets per family incl. Cyrillic.)
- **[perf] Jost omitted.** The original loads Jost but it is not used on any visible node
  (spec §2.1) — leftover. Not bundled.
- **[a11y/perf] Noto emoji/symbol fallback fonts NOT bundled; rely on the system emoji
  stack.** The original appends `Noto Sans` / `Noto Sans Symbols` / `Noto Sans Math` for
  flag/arrow/symbol runs. We let flags and arrows fall back to the OS emoji font, so flag
  glyph coverage is **font-stack dependent, not platform-level** — and the §03 flag row
  (10 flags, shipped 2026-07-16) is where that shows:
  - **macOS / iOS** (Apple Color Emoji) render the whole row correctly — regional-indicator
    pairs and the England/Scotland tag sequences alike.
  - **Chrome / Edge on Windows** fall back to **Segoe UI Emoji, which ships no country-flag
    glyphs at all.** The whole row degrades, not just the tag sequences: the 8
    regional-indicator pairs draw as boxed letter pairs (`US`, `NL`, …) and England/Scotland
    as two identical plain black flags 🏴. This is **not a regression** — the original's
    8-flag row already degraded the same way there.
  - **Firefox on Windows** bundles Twemoji Mozilla and renders both regional-indicator and
    subdivision flags correctly.
  - Android/Noto renders regional-indicator pairs; subdivision-flag support is newer, so
    treat England/Scotland there as unverified rather than assumed.

  **Accepted, not unnoticed:** the row is `aria-hidden="true"` decoration, the `10` stat
  beside it carries the actual meaning, and the flag **count** — and so the 5+5 wrap — holds
  regardless of glyph coverage (10 grapheme clusters either way; `text-wrap: balance`
  re-measures whatever the font gives it). Bundling Noto to fix it would cost far more than
  the blemish is worth. Cross-platform rendering variance is the price of the payload saving.

## Components & styling approximations

- **[arch] Light button uses a real `4px solid` border (padding pre-compensated),** not
  the original's absolutely-positioned outline overlay (`css-15fpuq`). Same look, simpler
  DOM; both button styles keep the same outer box size.
- **[approx] Letter-spacing is applied plainly;** the original's
  `.adjustLetterSpacing::after` trailing-gap-trim trick is not reproduced (negligible
  visual difference).
- **[arch] Mobile section-card band padding reduced to `40px 24px`** (desktop/tablet stay
  `52px`). The spec is desktop-canonical and silent on mobile card padding; 52px each
  side is unusable at 375px. Documented so it's an intentional, consistent adaptation.
- **[approx] Scroll-reveal entrance** (fade + `translateY ≈24px→0`, ~500ms ease-out, once
  on entry) is an approximation — the original's exact easing/duration/stagger is computed
  in JS and not externally measurable (spec §40.1). To be implemented in the later JS phase.
- **[approx] Sponsor-logo marquee** (~30–40s loop, white pills) approximates the original's
  runtime marquee (exact speed/direction unmeasured; spec §40.5). Section 03 owns it in CSS
  with a reduced-motion fallback.
- **[approx] Hover/press states.** The original has no static hover styles and showed no
  visible hover change when probed live (spec §40.4). Any press affordance a builder adds
  (e.g. nudging a button toward its shadow) is an optional approximation — log it.
- **[approx] Runtime-injected visuals** — the hero 862×350 photo collage (§02), the
  "supported BY" logo marquee (§03), and the footer googly-blob mascot row (§11) are
  absent from the static capture and reconstructed from live observation; treat their exact
  composition as approximate.
- **[approx] Page-wrapper rhythm (amendment 2026-07-15)** — `main#app` carries the
  original wrapper's `gap: 80px`, `max-width: 1600px`, and gutter (40px; 16px <800).
  Desktop values are capture-derived; the mobile wrapper gap was not separately
  verified and keeps 80px pending the integration visual pass.

## Mobile parity batch (2026-07-16)

- **[arch] Mobile display type is tokenized** (`tokens.css` mobile `:root`): H2 32/0.64,
  band-title 28/0.56, card-title 20/0.4, eyebrow/name 18 — transcribed from the original's
  own mobile classes; sections no longer hand-roll heading scaling (documented exceptions:
  §07's 28px H2, team/reviewer name+role 18/16).
- **[approx] Hero collage mobile bleed clips at the 16px content gutter,** not the true
  viewport edge (~16px less side-blob visible than the original). Center blob + all sizes
  exact. Full-bleed clip is a possible future refinement.
- **⚠️ LOUD (standing, re-flagged): 12-person roster (Dan first) and corrected figures
  (4,000+/10)** are kept on mobile; the original's mobile shows 8 people (Sofiia first)
  and the old contradictory figures.
- Team arrangement: initially shipped as a 2-col grid (logged divergence); superseded the
  same day by the operator-approved fast-path zigzag matching the original (see below).

## Per-section logs (consolidated at merge by the integrator)

- **§01 nav-sticky** — see `docs/deviations/01-nav-sticky.md`: single deduplicated logo
  SVG (three per-breakpoint files were the same art), logo as scroll-to-top button,
  nav-height measured 96/76px (token updated on main), active link styled like siblings.
- **§02 hero-header** — see `docs/deviations/02-hero-header.md`: chips/blob/collage as
  aria-hidden CSS placeholders (runtime-injected originals; asset-recovery task queued),
  clamp() mobile headline, -60px hero→stats overlap kept, data-reveal added at gate.
- **§03 stats** — see `docs/deviations/03-stats.md`: REAL sponsor logos shipped
  (recovered from page data, brand→hash mapping orchestrator-confirmed; same usage
  as the original site; licensing note logged), marquee approximations (36s loop,
  1400px cap, pause-on-hover), flags aria-hidden, flag row raised 8 → 10 to match the
  stat (England/Scotland as tag sequences; `text-wrap: balance` evens the 2-line wrap).
- **§04 for-vibe-coders** — see `docs/deviations/04-for-vibe-coders.md`: stable base
  city URLs, `rel="noopener"` on external links, city-row markup normalization, wrapper
  amendment adopted (no self-carried page rhythm), mobile flag sizing.
- **§05 project-showcase** — see `docs/deviations/05-project-showcase.md`: eyebrow
  green per corrected contract, cards stay a row at all breakpoints (capture-confirmed
  over the spec's guess), CDN images optimized, heading hierarchy.
- **§06 for-city-leaders** — see `docs/deviations/06-for-city-leaders.md`: map labels
  baked into the image (capture-verified, alt text carries the city list), 12-person
  desktop roster with capture-derived photo mapping (Luisa/Poppy shared-photo anomaly
  handled), avatars simplified to rounded rects (VISUAL-PASS ITEM: original blob-mask +
  blend tint), WebP-optimized assets, founders 2-up on mobile fixed at gate.

- **§07 for-sponsors** — see `docs/deviations/07-for-sponsors.md`: 32px partner title
  (spec's 20px prose was a transcription error, corrected at merge), single-`<ul>`
  two-column bullet grid with correct SR order, desktop-canonical lead phrases,
  off-white root compositing, noopener.
- **§09 for-companies** — see `docs/deviations/09-for-companies.md`: CDN images
  re-encoded to WebP with alpha, off-white root compositing, 20px card-gap literal,
  mobile h2 scaling, noopener.
- **§08 reviews** — see `docs/deviations/08-reviews.md`: figure/blockquote semantics
  upgrade, descriptive avatar alts (contract-ratified), 2+1 wrap faithful to the
  original under the 1600 cap, illustrated-avatar inset rule capture-validated,
  tablet flex-start alignment fixed at gate, left-offset artifact to visual pass.
- **§10 contact-cta** — see `docs/deviations/10-contact-cta.md`: email plain text
  (not mailto) per capture, `_self` CTA quirk preserved, smiley-sun doodle sourced
  from capture (was wrongly presumed runtime-injected), Email: label kept at all
  breakpoints (desktop-canonical).
- **§11 footer + interactions** — see `docs/deviations/11-footer.md`: WhatsApp kept as a
  link (`_self`) per ratified policy, real retro mark + wordmark SVGs sourced from the
  CDN, the "mascot row" resolved as the single 5-blob wordmark rendered large and
  bottom-cropped (page-data finding corrected the earlier six-blob live reading; scale/
  crop flagged for visual-pass tuning), reveal params approximation, no-JS gate
  (`html.js`), reduced-motion paths, `--red` token added at merge for the brand red.

## Progressive enhancement

- **[arch] No `#container{display:none}` boot-gate or `<noscript>` "enable JavaScript"
  wall.** The original hides content until its Figma runtime boots. Our content is plain
  static HTML/CSS and is fully usable with no JavaScript, so the gate is unnecessary.
